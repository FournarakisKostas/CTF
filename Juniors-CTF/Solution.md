#The Attack
The provided "LosT.exe" gets as input a key with length 32 characters{0-9,a-f}.</br>For each wrong character on the key, the output is '0' and for each right is '1' just like the image above.</br><img src="pictures/givenEXE.JPG"  /></br></br>To crack this key we need to change every character until its output is '1'.</br>I coded in c# a bruteforcer to do this job.</br><img src="pictures/Bruteforcer.JPG" /></br>##The source code is [HERE](https://github.com/FournarakisKostas/CTF/tree/master/Juniors-CTF/BruteForcer)
